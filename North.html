		<p style="color:biscuit">Some of the characteristics that make North Indian food special include: Use of ghee: Ghee, or clarified butter, is a staple ingredient in many North Indian dishes, and is used to add flavor and richness to a wide range of dishes, including curries, rice dishes, and breads.28 Dec 2022</p>

<h1>Garhwal ka fannah</h1>

			<p class="if">Garhwali cuisine relies heavily on grains and cereals, and the recipes are often relatively simple, using minimal spices. For the uninitiated, it may look like an offshoot of the popular dal makhani, but Garhwal ka fannah is vastly different. Made with horse gram lentil, ginger-garlic paste, and red chilli—cooked together then finished with coriander for garnish—it is a hearty dish that the locals in Uttarakhand swear by. (You can find it almost anywhere in the region.)</p>

			<p class="if">Translating to wild or jungle meat, this rustic dish is almost like an Indian take on Hunter’s Chicken, albeit dialed down several notches. The recipe requires only five basic ingredients: meat, ghee or oil, salt, water, and red chilies. It is the latter that imparts maximum flavor to the dish; the Mathania chilies, which get their name from a village in Rajasthan, were originally used to mask the gamey odor of the meat, which was typically rabbit or wild boar. Today, the protein of choice has changed to mutton, and chilies are used in moderation. For a particularly sublime experience, pair it with either bajra (pearl millet) or makai (corn) ki roti.</p>

		<p class="if">Also known as chana bhatura in some areas, this is an iconic Delhi dish that’s impossible to miss. An obvious choice for breakfast, the dish comprises puffy and fried leavened bread called bhatura, and a spiced chickpea curry called chole. The consistency of the chole may vary—some shops would make it spicier, some tangier, and some a little on the drier side—but the most important thing is to enjoy this at a street-side restaurant. Served with onion slivers, green chilies, and lemon, it hits on a different level when fresh. A generous squeeze of lemon onto the chole is particularly divine. (You can thank us later.)</p>

			<p class="if">Kadhi means a yogurt-based sauce, while pakora means fritters—making this dish, which feels like a warm hug on a bad day, pretty self-explanatory. Made from a batter of chickpea flour, onions, and spices, the crunchy fritters are added to the tangy yogurt curry made with cumin, coriander, red chili, and ginger powder. It is then finished with a tempering of fenugreek, cumin, dry red chili, and asafoetida. Once you get used to the sour aftertaste, it is all sorts of wonderful; scarf it up with some rice for maximum satisfaction.</p>
